# display1593
Drivers and sample code for an irregular 1593-LED light 
display array.

The 1593-LED irregular light array contains two Teensy 3.1
microcontrollers mounted on OctoWS2811 adaptor boards 
communicating with 16 led strips (8 strips connected to
each Teensy).

Each strip contains around 98 to 100 DC5V WS2811 LEDs 
arranged in an irregular pattern on a 5 x 5 foot display.

The Teensy driver code uses the OctoWS2811 LED Library
